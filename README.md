<p>Assignment and Communication<p/>

- Default settings does not assign this ticket to a team, so Jane assigns the ticket to Support team to address the issue and elevated it to SEV-A plan based on severity.
- As we work through the issue, we ensure proper communictations with all parties involved.

<p>This is a simple scenario, but it provides an idea of how an end user submits a ticket and how the help desk team views it, determines the best course of action based on the ticket's severity, assigns it to the appropriate team, and communicates with the end user. </p>
